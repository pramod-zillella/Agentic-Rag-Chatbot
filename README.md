# Agentic RAG Fitness Chatbot

## Overview
The Agentic RAG Fitness Chatbot is an AI-powered application designed to provide personalized fitness guidance and workout recommendations. It leverages cutting-edge AI technologies, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and a curated knowledge base, to deliver context-aware and actionable fitness advice. The chatbot focuses on empowering beginners with evidence-based fitness recommendations, real-time video demonstrations, and safety guidelines.

## Architecture
The system consists of the following components:

1. **User Input**: Accepts user queries through a Streamlit-based chat interface.
2. **Query Refinement**: Transforms user input into an optimized format using an LLM-based query rewriting mechanism.
3. **Retrieval System**:
   - Encodes user queries using Sentence Transformers.
   - Queries the Pinecone vector database to fetch relevant fitness data.
   - Retrieves video demonstrations and transcripts.
4. **Response Generation**: Synthesizes retrieved information using GPT-4o, ensuring the response is actionable and grounded in context.
5. **Video Recommendations**: Displays video thumbnails, titles, and links alongside detailed transcripts.
6. **Langsmith Integration**: Tracks agent-level decisions and improves overall system reliability.

## Langsmith Trace and LangGraph Workflow
To provide transparency and insights into the system's behavior, the Langsmith trace and LangGraph workflow have been visualized:

### Langsmith Trace
The Langsmith Trace captures the flow of the chatbot’s decision-making process, including tool calls and their respective responses. Below is an example trace showcasing a user query and the system's response:

### LangGraph Workflow
The LangGraph Workflow outlines the sequence of nodes in the system’s architecture. Each node represents a specific function, from query handling to generating responses. Below is the compiled workflow:
